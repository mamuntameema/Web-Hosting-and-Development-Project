<h2><u>"The Queen on Stage"</u></h2>
</center>

<p>Elizabeth Victoria Kingsley. Her mastery in singing the notes, resonating the perfect pitch, and especially, producing the most glorious but ear-catching tone, yielded the nickname, "Euphonious Elizabeth." Her poisonous desire to become the best, international opera singer gave her the opportunity to move herself up the ranks. She attended Julliard, the top performing arts conservatory that had ever been created in the only world that she knew. From a young age, she would gain attention from the cold, stern judges at small-town competitions, and her voice became stronger and stronger the more that she practiced.</p>
<p>Training Elizabeth throughout her childhood, her mother batted an eye when the notes had gone wrong. Her mother's eyes had turned into lasers, pinpointing the slightest changes in pitch, and catching onto every mistake. "Elizabeth...stop. Right now." Elizabeth froze. Her mother stealthily walked around the room, reversed, and walked back in an incomplete circle. She held a cane with both hands, tapping them ever so slightly on Elizabeth's shoulders. "You know what I've given you this opportunity. Seize it. Don't think about it. Prove to me that you are the daughter I raised." Elizabeth hustled. She never stopped. And now, she couldn't have been better, because indeed, she was better than everyone. No one could reach her almost flawless F note - except Elizabeth herself. The only question was, â€œDid she earn it?â€ </p>
<p>She was perceived as an elegant woman, showing off her wealthy family background any chance that she could get. Owning "the" Penthouse made it too easy to woo all the men who were chasing her after her money, and especially those who wanted her for the high of drinking wine under a starry night in the most expensive home that one could get. On a regular basis, she wore all black- head to toe- and on her performing days, she wore stunning, over-the-top dresses that people couldn't ever dream of affording, let alone work for it. Her red, flashy lips drew a smirk to all the photographers clicking her pictures during brilliant performances. As Director of Belleville Arts center, she had the foundation of her music school wrapped around her finger, and reputation was key to staying relevant in the opera world. Though she had both a husband and a daughter, she never paid much attention to them. In her eyes, her daughter's singing was incompetent, and her husband was just a mere alcoholic. They weren't worth her time, as there were singing opportunities opening from door to door.</p>
<p>Using her time wisely, she began to prepare for the upcoming recital that would be showcased in front of millions of people, and especially, the renowned master vocalists, who would seal the deal to gain the funds for Belleville Arts Center. She would have to blow them away with her vocals. Thus, she practiced in her grand music room at the Penthouse, throwing a fit over which song would gain the best attention from her fans. After contemplating various works of music, she picked "The Queen of the Night" by Mozart. She worked. And she kept working until she overworked. Though she started to feel a slight tension in her throat, she brushed it off. Her thoughts repeated continuously in the back of her mind, "I can't lose, not after everything I've done to get to this point." Two days before the recital, she grabbed her throat as it turned into an unbearable misery of pain, and all of the glamorous pitches she had practiced were gone. Waiting in the doctor's office, he came out with a diagnosis. "Muscle tension dysphonia," he said, "there's no chance that you will be able to perform in two days. If you overuse your vocal chords without resting fully these next two weeks, you may never be able to sing. Ever." Elizabeth was too stunned to speak, and anger rose out of her. "This performance is <i>the</i> most important thing on my agenda. You mean to tell me, I can't perform?" The doctor gulped. "It's only for your own good Ms. Kingsley." Elizabeth raced home. She broke her flower vases, ripped her fancy dresses, and shoved all the belongings sitting on her office desk right onto the floor. After venting profusely, she looked frantically around the room for her telephone. She picked it up, and dialed her Secretary's number, "Get here. STAT. I need you to find someone...actually anyone."</p>
<p>After her secretary arrived, Elizabeth gave instructions to find any top vocalist who would be willing to sing in her place for three million dollars. They needed to be discreet. No one could find out that she was lip-syncing to someone else's voice who would be able to entirely match hers. She had no choice. Elizabeth needed to show her audience that the definition of talent was standing right in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>The secretary notified Elizabeth that he has found a woman. He listed, "Name: Lia Faze. Age: 35. No identified background. Poor. Runs a small town business. Matches Elizabeth's singing. F note is better than average. Her secretary also let Elizabeth know that this small-town singer would like to remain anonymous, as being face-to-face wasn't really her thing, and requested that the money be wired to her as soon as the grand opera recital was over. Elizabeth became hesitant at first, but soon agreed. Though Elizabeth had never met this woman, Lia, it was a matter of life and death- well for her reputation at least. Everything would go according to the plan: Elizabeth would appear in front of the audience, while Lia hides behind the curtains in a corner off to the stage, and sings into the microphone. Simultaneously, as Lia sings, Elizabeth would be lip-syncing. The plan couldn't have been more foolproof than it already was.</p>
<p>On the day of the recital, crowds of people were lining up outside the concert hall, buying tickets for friends and family. A sign outside of the concert hall had Elizabeth's photograph, titled "Come to see the one and only star, Elizabeth Victoria Kingsley." As audience members were taking their seats, Elizabeth was in the backstage room. Her makeup artists finished styling her hair and makeup, as well as touching up her white, lacey gown with golden trimmed edges. After her makeup artists left, Elizabeth waited patiently for Lia, checking her watch and looking up to see if anyone had walked through the door every 30 seconds or so. "Ms. Kingsley, are you ready to head onto the stage?"her secretary asked, looking down immediately. "No- not yet,"she replied. Elizabeth wasn't ready. The renowned master vocalists sitting in their reserved seats, front row, would soon find out that she was a fraud. Fearing for her life and her heart beating twice as fast, Elizabeth walked out of the backstage room, waving to the audience from left to right, and again from then right to left. Wanting to stall so very badly, she took ever so slow steps to the center of the stage, when she heard her secretary speaking in the earpiece hiding underneath the locks of her hair:"Lia's here." </p>
<p>Elizabeth took a deep breath, lip-syncing the melody the way that it went, and feeling relieved that Lia arrived in time. Elizabeth wished her voice was back to the way that it was, as she wondered how amazing it would've been to sing the song herself, but of course, the circumstances of her throat would not allow her to do so. However, Elizabeth was content that Lia had the ability to sing like her, since it had been quite difficult to find someone as good of a singer as her. In such short notice As the song was about to come to an end, Elizabeth worried anxiously as Lia must reach the high F note, which Elizabeth was known for doing almost perfectly without any errors. As Lia sang the high F note, Elizabeth lip-synced as well, expecting to end the song after a short note. However, Lia sang the F note perfectly, actually, a little too perfectly, and ended with an F note that was much longer than the opera song. "Lia's voice is surprisingly powerful, Elizabeth pondered. As Elizabeth sensed that something was off, she thought to herself, "It can't be her, can it? No, impossible."</p>
<p>The master vocalists stood up, clapping immensely and smiling as if they had seen the next big hit. The audience members tossed roses in Elizabeth's direction, and she blew kisses out to her fans in return. However, Elizabeth was eager to meet the anonymous woman who had sung for her tonight, so she waved her goodbyes and began searching for Lia. As the audience started to leave, Elizabeth walked down the steps of the backstage, and opened a red curtain. She found a woman standing in front of her, a corner off to the side of the stage, with a bright yellow light shining upon her blonde hair, with a mask and sunglasses on. She was wearing a blue coat, and looked mysterious. Elizabeth asked, "Are you Lia? I just wanted to thank you for singing for me tonight. I've already wired the money to you. Do you mind taking off your mask?" Lia responded, "Sorry. No can do, and started to walk off into the other direction. Elizabeth yanked Lia's hair, who's blonde wig fell into Elizabeth's hand. Elizabeth was shocked, and proceeded to tear off Lia's mask from behind. "Turn around, now, Elizabeth demanded. Lia rotated her head about 90 degrees, making a little smirk with her lips, and slowly circled around to face Elizabeth. "You- you- Amelia? I got rid of you years ago. What are you doing here?"Elizabeth stuttered. "What? You believed my fake name? You thought you could do what you did 20 years ago and move on with your life? I'm going to bring down that reputation you've built. Don't even think about being clever. You won't get away with it this time.â€ </p>
<p>Elizabeth got pulled into a trance, and felt as if she had gone 20 years back into time. At Davidson High School, the choir always struggled. There were not enough sopranos that could tune into the high notes, and the altos were mediocre needless to say. However, Elizabeth Kingsley always brought up the standards-made them so high that no one could reach them. Not one of the music students was able to compare to her singing voice. Until Amelia Fascia came into the picture. Joining the high school choir in her sophomore year, she outbeat Elizabeth. Only one student from Davidson was able to get the opportunity to go to Julliard, where the musical arts thrived. Instead of Elizabeth, the school board members had announced that Amelia earned the spot, along with a trophy. Elizabeth's temper got out of hand, and she considered the spot more as stolen than deserved. After school one day in the high school music room, Elizabeth fought with Amelia for the trophy and for her spot back, grabbing her hair and swinging at each other's faces behind the piano. Elizabeth clenched her teeth, and swung the edge of the trophy across Amelia's neck, slashing her throat. Amelia's neck was gushing with blood, and she was rushed to the hospital. Elizabeth knew that Amelia could no longer attend Julliard as she no longer had a singing voice, and after all, no one would believe Amelia as she was a poor girl with a drunkard father, making money through working as a mere tutor, whereas Elizabeth was brought up from a wealthy family, and her mother gave her advantages in the music industry to bury any evidence of the event. </p>
<p>Amelia snapped her fingers in Elizabeth's face. Elizabeth awoke from her trance, sensing reality, and grabbed Amelia by her shirt. "How did you manage to get your measly little voice back?" she said brutally in a cold-hearted tone. Amelia scoffed and grabbed Elizabeth's wrist, pushing it forcefully away from her. Amelia gently brushed off her shirt, putting her hands in the pockets of her blue coat, and looked off to the side. She said, "I got a laryngectomy-there was a lot of risk, but it was worth it. My voice is now fixed." Turning back towards Elizabeth's direction, she continued, "After your dangerous little stunt in high school, I was going to give up on my dreams completely. But now, I'm back. My voice is back. And you're not taking it from me again."</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded, "Is that so? Well then-" and she grabbed Amelia's arm, dragging her up the stairs to backstage. Amelia made muffled noises and kicked her feet as Elizabeth held her mouth shut tightly, sliding her across the floor into the balcony. Amelia finally got a hold of herself and managed to escape from Elizabeth's grip, but couldn't get back into the backstage room. Amelia made fists with her hands and thrusted at the glass doors, trying to make noise for anyone nearby to save her. Elizabeth headlocked her arm under Amelia's chin, trying to swing her off the railing of the balcony. Amelia kicked Elizabeth's shins, and Elizabeth groaned in pain on the ground. Amelia grabbed Elizabeth's wrist, then used her other hand to grab her throat. Amelia pushed her against the railing with all her strength, with Elizabeth's upper body already halfway across the ledge. Before Amelia kicked Elizabeth's feet up to fall three stories down the balcony, Amelia whispered, "You can't be the Queen on stage when the stage isn't even yours to begin with."</p>
<p>And just like that, no one heard from Elizabeth again.</p>
